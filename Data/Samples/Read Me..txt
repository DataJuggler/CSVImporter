The first sample NYSE is a sample from the website www.eoddata.com.

This is a great resource for end of day stock data. It is free if you sign up and you can download about 4 weeks of data, and they also sell
historyical data for as far back as 20 years.

I only included 1 day from my account as a sample, so I would not think they would mind in exchange for the plug I just gave them.

The second sample pfilerr.csv is the reason this project exists, as I was answering a Stack Overflow question about CSVHelper, a project
I heard of yesterday for the first time. I have never used CSVHelper, so I cannot say anything about it either way.

It has probably been tested a 1,000 times more than this project as I built this in the last 24 hours.

The purpose of this project is to show how DataTier.Net can be used in Conjunction with this project to do some things that you 
can't do with Entity Framework, such as the SetFieldValues.sql, which create C# code to set in your import project just by 
reading the DTNFields for your table.
